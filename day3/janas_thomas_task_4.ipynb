    "    The original calculations without a cutoff was about -3487.45, whereas the calculations with a cutoff of a distance 3 resulted in -3582.23. This is approximately a 2.6% error and we think this would be a tolerable cutoff because it is less than 5%.\n",

    "2.  \n",
    "    Using a cutoff helps reduce the amount of calculation processing, which can help reduce computer memory usage and allow for more particles to be considered. As said in lecture, we are only at a point where a factor of millions of particles can be processed with calculations like these, yet a single mole contains 6.022*10^23. It is very helpful for us to minimize possibly negligible processing when we can to maximize our resources.\n",

    "My first step with this task was trying to understand what the purpose of the periodic boundaries are for. After thinking about the concepts from lecture and discussing with the group, I realized it just helps to simulate the particles in an open space, whereas the simulations would in reality occur in a limited box based on the min and max of the random coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the task, I made a function called modified_distance_calculation and I went into the calculate_total_energy function and changed it to use this new distance calculation instead of the old one. After our solid discussion and reading through the task, I tried to conceptualize how these imaginary boxes would work mathematically. The point would simply be repositioned if any of its coordinates was more than box_length/2 and after looking at examples and and modifying the points myself, I came up with the equation (for x here) x = box_length - x if x was larger than box_length/2. I felt like this was rather simple, but conceptually it does fulfill the imaginary boxes we spoke about in class. I developed a bunch of asserts statements, which probably could be simplified into 1 point having each coordinate changed instead of only altering 1 coordinate for each assert.After that, we ended up getting the same numbers that the NIST website listed, which was very satisfying to see. I remember earlier today I was not sure how the periodic boundaries worked, and I was somewhat uncomfortable with the coding for cutoff, but it all makes sense to me now. Which is very nice.\n"
