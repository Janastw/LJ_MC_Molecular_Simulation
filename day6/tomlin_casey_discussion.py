# Exercise 1 from Think Python

n = 42
# 42 = n , variables cannot start with a number, illegal character or use a keyword

x = y = 1 # This doesn't produce an error, but it does make the code look messy
print(x)
print(y)

x = 3;
print(x) # It appears it does not matter that the expression ends with a ;

y = 2. # This assigns y the float value of 2.0 instead of the integer 2
print(y)
y = "Bob". # This does give an error and is not allowed

# x y , you must use the * operator to perform multiplication in Python 
x * y
