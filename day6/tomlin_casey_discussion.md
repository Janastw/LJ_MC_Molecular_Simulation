# Discussion

1. Python intuits the variable type based on the data that the variable stores.
    apple = 42

   C++ you must state the data type before the variable name.
    int apple = 42;

2. C++ variable names also cannot start with a number, it must be either a letter or underscore.

3. An expression is a combination of values, variables and operators.
Python: 42
C++: 42

4. Similar to both languages, the user can describe the start, stop and step of a loop function. In python though, this must done with the `range()` function where those variables are included in the parentheses. C++ holds a native support for this in the compiler where the `for()` function handles the variables, but you must instruct C++ to increase the variable as you loop through. All statements within the C++ `for` loop must be grouped within `{}`.

5. C++ is a compiled language that has more direct directions for the CPU to handle, thus making it slightly faster than Python which needs to interpret the code into a more basic set of instructions that the CPU can understand.

6. Details and explanations of each version of the exercise are commented within the `.py` and `.cpp` files.
